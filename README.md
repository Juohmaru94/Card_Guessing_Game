Developed a text-based card guessing game. The aim of the game is for the player to go through an entire
deck of cards while trying to guess the wrong value of each face down card. In the event where the value of a card
was guessed correctly, the game ended and the player lost. This pilot project served as a stepping stone to
get me excited and motivated about future app and web development projects.
